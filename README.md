# Car_Price_Analysis

The recent surge in the pre-owned car market has signified a shift in consumer preference towards used vehicles, primarily due to their affordability and practicality. This trend underscores the importance of accurately predicting used car prices. The project focuses on estimating the prices of used cars by analyzing critical factors such as production year, model, mileage, engine capacity, safety features, and taxes. Linear regression, a proven statistical technique for predictive analysis, is employed to process and analyze raw data. The process begins with an extensive data cleaning phase, followed by model selection, training, and testing to validate the model's accuracy. The intended outcome is a reliable linear regression model capable of providing precise price predictions in the used car marketplace.


The project deals with used cars in the United States. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com and scraped in order to build the effective intelligent model. The dataset consists of 19237 rows and 18 different columns.
